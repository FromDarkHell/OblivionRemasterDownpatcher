## Oblivion Remastered Downpatcher

This is a downpatcher for *specifically* the **Steam** versions of [The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2623190/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered/). This downloads the files from Steam itself in order to avoid pre-packaging 110GB files ðŸ˜©

### Why do I need to input my Username / Password?

Since this is interacting directly with Steam, it needs your username / password in order to access and download the files for Oblivion (this way, it knows you have bought the game!). Once you input your password once, it will keep the password securely stored. This way you won't need to input the password once you do it the first time.

DepotDownloader (and SteamKit2 which DepotDownloader uses) are all open-source and available on GitHub.

### Credits

- [SteamRE/DepotDownloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader) - This entire project would not exist without DepotDownloader; Otherwise I'd have to completely package 110GB of game and I'd rather not do that. Shoutouts to the DepotDownloader devs and SteamRE team!
- [apple1417/BL3SteamDownpatcher](https://github.com/apple1417/BL3SteamDownpatcher/) - *alot* of the logic from this program came from this repo, many thanks to him!
